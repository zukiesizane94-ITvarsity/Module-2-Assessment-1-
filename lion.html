                    <h3>lion</h3>        
                    <p>The lion is a large felid of the genus Panthera native mainly to Africa. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions have a prominent mane.</p>
                    <p>Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, the lion is the second largest cat in the world. ... Unlike other cats, lions are very social animals. They live in groups, called prides, of around 30 lions. A pride consists of up to three males, a dozen related females, and their young.</p>
                    <p>Lions are symbols of strength and courage and have been celebrated throughout history for these characteristics. They are also common symbols for royalty and stateliness, hence the phrase 'king of the jungle'. Ancient Egyptians venerated lions as their war dieties due to their strength, power and fierceness.</p>
                       <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                        <p>Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the Sahara Desert, but one small population exists around Gir Forest National Park in western India. Lions in west and central Africa are more closely related to these Asiatic lions in India, than to those found in southern and east Africa.</p>
